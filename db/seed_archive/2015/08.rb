The Glencairn Whiskey Tasting Glass was designed by Raymond Davidson of Glencairn Crystal in Scotland and came into production in 2001.

Its pear shaped design is based on the nosing copitas used in whiskey laboratories all over the world and was made with the help of master blenders from the largest whiskey makers in Scotland.

While the snifter is a popular vessel, the curves shape of the Glencairn Whiskey Tasting Glass concentrates the aroma of the whiskey while minimizing evaporation, and it's fun to have a special glass to use when cracking open a Glenfarclas 25 or Taketsuru 21.

This pre-seasoned Skillet works like a charm right out of the box. Pancakes, eggs, and bacon somehow taste extra hearty when cooked in a heavy cast-iron skillet. Cast iron creates superior heat retention, heats evenly, and loves a campfire, unlike flimsier pans. Fry up a mess of catfish, roast chicken, or bake an apple crisp in this 8-inch pan that features a sturdy handle for heavy lifting, and two subtle side lips for pouring. While the skillet comes pre-seasoned to prevent food from sticking, it works best when sprayed or lightly coated with vegetable oil before use. The Lodge seasoning procedure is a multiple-step process in which the seasoning oil is applied via an electrostatic spray system that coats the cookware, then it's baked in commercial ovens at very high temperatures. This allows the oil to penetrate deeply into the pores of the iron."""

Cast iron is impossible to beat for heat retention, and Lodge has been making them since 1896. The Lodge Cast Iron Skillet is the perfect tool for recipes that start on the stove and end up in the oven, and is my weapon of choice for a ribeye steak.

Cast iron is the original non-stick surface since its high specific heat allows it to maintain high temperatures that vaporize liquids on contact, preventing them from sticking. The Lodge Cast Iron Skillet is preseasoned, but in the event it's damaged it can be reapplied simply by wiping down with oil and baking upside down at high temperatures.

Cast iron does rust if left in contact with water, but can be cleaned by scrubbing down with salt and wiping clean with oil.

While it's possible to use the EatSmart Precision Pro Scale for dieting, I like to use it to measure the dry weight of ingredients for baking. Bread in particular is sensitive to the amounts of ingredients since almost every bread is made frome the same four primary ingredients: flour, water, yeast, and salt.

Flour, and salt in particular can be difficult to measure because how well it's packed can influence cause a different amounts to fit into the same volume. Measuring the mass of ingredients fixes this problem, making a digital scale an essential tool for anyone pursuing baking as a hobby.

While there are scales with more features or more impressive designs, the EatSmart Precision Pro Digital Kitchen Scale met all my needs at a compact size and an affordable price.
